;; Configuration for emacs variables

;;; Code:
(defun +emacs/search (string)
  (interactive "sSearch: ")
  (start-process "Search the internet"
                 nil
                 "firefox"
                 "--search"
                 string))

;; "Opt out" of custom-set-variables.
;; These variables will still be viewable after they are set,
;; but they will dissapear upon the cleaning of /tmp/.
(setq custom-file "/tmp/emacs-custom.el")

;; Enable some disabled methods
(put 'upcase-region 'disabled nil)



(provide '+emacs)
;;; +emacs.el ends here
