#+Title: Etoile -- An emacs config using the straight package manager
#+Author: Jacob Salzberg

* Goals
The goal of this config is to
1. Use the straight package manager to manage packages,
   including cloning and building repositories.
   
2. Break up my emacs config into reusable parts
   
3. Be usable from any linux computer without hassle.
   

* Guidelines
1. Use use-package for every package loaded
2. Every package can be fetched from github (or another source defined by straight)
   that is to say, :straight should not be nil for any package
3. If the configuration of a package takes more than ten lines, add an auxilary package
   called +[package_name] that contains the configuration
4. :defer when possible, :demand otherwise (but never leave that unspecified)
